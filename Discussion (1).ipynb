        "\n",
        "The objective of this project was to predict road accident severity based on features such as the number of vehicles, number of casualties, weather condition, road surface, and light conditions. By employing a linear regression model, we aimed to understand the relationship between these factors and accident severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Data Preprocessing**\n",
        "The dataset required categorical data handling, where variables like `Weather_Condition`, `Road_Surface`, and `Light_Conditions` were converted into numeric values through one-hot encoding. This encoding expanded the dataset with additional columns, allowing the model to interpret categorical variables as separate, meaningful features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Model Training and Evaluation**\n",
        "The dataset was split into training and testing subsets, and a linear regression model was trained on the training data. Model evaluation was performed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values, which provided insights into the model’s accuracy and the degree to which the independent variables explain the variance in accident severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This metric showed how close the predictions were to actual values on average.\n",
        "- **R-squared (R²)**: This indicated the model's ability to explain the variance in accident severity, with a higher R² value suggesting a better fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Findings**\n",
        "The model produced reasonable predictions based on new, hypothetical data. The chosen features provided a foundational insight into accident severity, where conditions like weather and lighting seemed to affect the severity outcomes. However, linear regression may have limitations for such a dataset, as accident severity could have complex, nonlinear dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Limitations and Recommendations**\n",
        "- **Feature Limitations**: Additional features such as road type, driver demographics, or vehicle types could improve accuracy.\n",
        "- **Model Limitations**: Exploring other models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) may yield better performance by capturing non-linear relationships within the data.\n",
        "- **Data Size**: A larger dataset would further strengthen model accuracy and generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the linear regression model provided an initial understanding of the factors contributing to road accident severity. Further improvements with additional data and advanced modeling techniques could enhance prediction accuracy and provide valuable insights into road safety measures.\n",
